## Introduction
This project provides an in-depth analysis of power plants across Germany and the European Union. It aims to offer insights into the distribution, capacity, and types of energy sources utilized within these regions. By visualizing and examining this data, the project seeks to enhance our understanding of the current energy landscape and historical developments that have shaped it.

## Historical Context
Energy has been a pivotal factor in the development of Germany. Historically, Europe has undergone significant transformations in its energy sector, driven by both technological advancements and geopolitical shifts.

### Project Overview
This project leverages data on power plants from Germany to analyze various aspects such as:

The distribution of power plants by energy source
Efficiency metrics by technology type
Regional disparities in energy production
The prevalence of cogeneration (CHP) plants
Using visualizations, such as geographic scatter plots and capacity distribution charts, this analysis provides a comprehensive view of the energy sector's current state and its historical trajectory. By understanding these dynamics, we can better appreciate the progress made towards sustainable energy and identify areas for future improvement.

### Insights and Recommendations:
- The transition to renewable and cleaner energy sources is underway, but dependence on coal and natural gas still persists in several regions. Germany may need to accelerate the decommissioning of coal-fired power plants to achieve its sustainability goals.
- The use of hydropower and run-of-river is a positive point in terms of renewable sources, but the expansion of other sources such as solar and wind will be crucial for the energy transition.
- The power transmission infrastructure is well developed, with large grid operators dominating the sector. This could facilitate the integration of more renewable sources and emerging technologies such as distributed solar and energy storage.
- Power plant efficiency could be further improved with more investment in combined cycle and clean technologies.

## 1. Germany üá©üá™
A leading industrial nation, has experienced a notable evolution in its energy policies. Post-World War II, the country relied heavily on coal and nuclear power to fuel its economic growth. However, in the wake of the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 and the subsequent rise in environmental awareness, Germany began transitioning towards more sustainable energy sources. The Energiewende, or "energy transition," initiated in the early 2000s, marked a significant shift with an emphasis on increasing the share of renewable energy sources like wind and solar power. Today, Germany is a global leader in renewable energy and energy efficiency, striving to reduce its carbon footprint and achieve a sustainable energy future. 

Some relevant information about the German energy system. The germany average age of power plants is 39 years. The west and south of Germany are the regions where the most important power plants are located. 
The status of the plants in 2020 was as follows:

| Status                    | N     |
|:------------------------:|:---------------:|
| ‚ö° Operating              |       723       |
| ‚õî Shutdown              |       110       |
| üåü Special Case          |        16       |
| ‚è∏ Shutdown Temporary     |        15       |
| üîã Reserve               |         8       |
| üçÉ Seasonal Conservation |         7       |

NRW (North Rhine-Westphalia) leads with 228 power plants. This can be explained by the high energy demand in the region and the concentration of large industrial and urban centers. Bayern (Bavaria) and Baden-W√ºrttemberg are the next two regions with the highest number of plants, which also reflects the economic development and energy needs of these areas. The plants in Baden-W√ºrttemberg are somewhat fewer, but the region is known as a center of technological innovation, which may indicate a strong emphasis on cleaner or more efficient energy sources.

### üåç Power Plants by State:
- ‚ö° **NRW (North Rhine-Westphalia)**: 228 power plants
- üèû **Bayern (Bavaria)**: 168 power plants
- üå≤ **Baden-W√ºrttemberg**: 95 power plants

Natural gas is the most widely used energy source (305 plants), followed by hydropower (137 plants) and coal (119 plants). The high reliance on natural gas reflects Germany‚Äôs ongoing energy transition, which is seeking to reduce its dependence on coal and increase the share of cleaner energy sources. Hydropower remains an important source, despite regional variations and the scarcity of large rivers. This also indicates a strong push towards renewable and sustainable energy sources. The significant presence of coal (mainly hard coal) still persists, despite the movement to reduce carbon emissions and adopt greener energy sources. This is likely related to older plants still operating, before a broader transition to renewables.

### üîã Most Used Energy Sources:
- üî• **Natural Gas**: 305 plants
- üíß **Hydro**: 137 plants
- ‚öí **Hard Coal**: 119 plants

The predominant technology in power generation is the steam turbine (537 plants), which is traditionally associated with thermal and power plants. This may indicate that Germany‚Äôs power generation infrastructure is still heavily based on more traditional technologies, even with the increasing use of renewable sources. The combined cycle (113 plants), which is more efficient and used in gas-fired power plants, also has a notable presence, reflecting an attempt to improve efficiency and reduce carbon emissions in thermal power plants. Run-of-river technology (86 plants), which uses the natural flow of rivers to generate power, is a greener and more renewable source, in line with Germany‚Äôs efforts to transition to a cleaner energy mix.

### üè≠ Most Used Power Generation Technologies:

## Main questions

### 1. What is the distribution of plant capacity by energy source type?

**Most of the installed capacity comes from non-renewable sources**, which indicates a **significant challenge for energy sustainability**. The presence of hydropower as a renewable source is a positive point, but it also highlights the need for diversification of energy sources to ensure a successful, sustainable energy transition capable of meeting demand safely.

### 2. How does the gross capacity of power plants vary over the years?

Gross capacity over time shows the evolution of installed capacity over the years. We can see that there were 3 major peaks, between 1984-1989, 2002 and 2012.

### 3. What is the average efficiency of power plants, and how does it vary by technology type?
