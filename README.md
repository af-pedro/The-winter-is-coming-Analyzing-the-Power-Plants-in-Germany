## Introduction
This project provides an in-depth analysis of power plants across Germany and the European Union. It aims to offer insights into the distribution, capacity, and types of energy sources utilized within these regions. By visualizing and examining this data, the project seeks to enhance our understanding of the current energy landscape and historical developments that have shaped it.

## Historical Context
Energy has been a pivotal factor in the development of Germany. Historically, Europe has undergone significant transformations in its energy sector, driven by both technological advancements and geopolitical shifts.

### Project Overview
This project leverages data on power plants from Germany to analyze various aspects such as:

The distribution of power plants by energy source
Efficiency metrics by technology type
Regional disparities in energy production
The prevalence of cogeneration (CHP) plants
Using visualizations, such as geographic scatter plots and capacity distribution charts, this analysis provides a comprehensive view of the energy sector's current state and its historical trajectory. By understanding these dynamics, we can better appreciate the progress made towards sustainable energy and identify areas for future improvement.

I hope this analysis serves as a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and anyone interested in the evolution of energy systems in Germany and the European Union.

## 1. Germany 🇩🇪
A leading industrial nation, has experienced a notable evolution in its energy policies. Post-World War II, the country relied heavily on coal and nuclear power to fuel its economic growth. However, in the wake of the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 and the subsequent rise in environmental awareness, Germany began transitioning towards more sustainable energy sources. The Energiewende, or "energy transition," initiated in the early 2000s, marked a significant shift with an emphasis on increasing the share of renewable energy sources like wind and solar power. Today, Germany is a global leader in renewable energy and energy efficiency, striving to reduce its carbon footprint and achieve a sustainable energy future. 

Some relevant information about the German energy system. The germany average age of power plants is 39 years. The status of the plants in 2020 was as follows:

| Status                    | N     |
|:------------------------:|:---------------:|
| ⚡ Operating              |       723       |
| ⛔ Shutdown              |       110       |
| 🌟 Special Case          |        16       |
| ⏸ Shutdown Temporary     |        15       |
| 🔋 Reserve               |         8       |
| 🍃 Seasonal Conservation |         7       |
